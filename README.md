# EVE Manager - For we players in Dawn[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lllvantis/eve-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lllvantis/eve-manager)

In the server Dawn, we can only add skills to be trained limited. So we need to know when our skill training bar will be empty.
 
This project targets on this.

You can:

* manage your EVE account everywhere.
* launch the game from the website after telling the EVE Manager where the game is.

WARNING: We do not request your EVE account password forcibly, but you should take care:

**DO NOT USE YOUR EVE ACCOUNT PASSWORD AS YOUR EVE MANAGER PASSWORD!**

*If you choose to save your EVE account's password in the EVE Manager, the password will be saved in the database encrypted.*
